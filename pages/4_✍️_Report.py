st.header('EXECUTIVE SUMMARY')
st.write('''
Latter Day Saint Charities (The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) provided a \$6,925 grant to
Bright Water Foundation (BWF) in early 2021 to provide safe water education in the Sankubenase
Village Safe Water Project (Project). The Project is a water quality initiative aimed at strengthening
family self-reliance by teaching village households how to independently treat household water
supplies and ensuring safe water storage. The Project includes the villages of Sankubenase, Nkurakan,
Amonom, Mampong and Wekpeti in the Atiwa West District, Eastern Region, of Ghana.
The Project was launched in Sept 2021 with BWF U.S. and Ghana Management Staff training local safe
water educators (SWEs) and volunteers. Training included instruction on: 
1. How to test local community and household water sources
2. How to teach safe water principles and practices including storage and treatment
3. How to effectively interview and collect periodic household information using a cell phone application


Since the Project kick-off, there have been 35 volunteers
trained resulting in 4,214 adults reported taught and approximately 1,500 school children instructed
from eight Primary and Jr High schools. An in-person survey was conducted with a systematic (20%)
household sample at the onset of the Project prior to the intervention. Several follow-up in-person
surveys were conducted with the same sample households during the year. Of the 159 families
surveyed, 71-80% reported (Sept. ’22 and June ’22 respectively) that they now “always” treat their
water. In addition, there was reported a 47% reduction in reported diarrhea cases in children less than
five year of age.
The grant of \$6,925 helped offset the total Project costs to date of \$10,366. The grant funds provided
water testing kits, drinking water stations at schools, chlorine disinfectant tablets for households, and
costs for village education, student education, public service announcements and periodic surveys.
Management and training materials costs were the responsibility of BWF.

st.subheader('I. Safe Drinking Water Initiative Overview')
st.write('''
The purpose of the BWF safe water education initiative is to strengthen family self-reliance by teaching
households how to independently treat home water supplies and ensure safe water storage. BWF
provides a unique community-led and self-directed “Teach-Test-Treat” village safe water education
program, using a simple science-based water testing method and village-friendly training and
education materials. This initiative supports the Government of Ghana’s strategic plan to increase the
people’s knowledge of household safe drinking water. The Ghana Government, in May 2014, launched
a National Household Water Treatment and Safe Storage (HWTS) Strategy which is aimed at increasing
knowledge, awareness and practice of HWTS. The purpose is to reduce water related diseases and
contribute to achieving health for all by 2025. The strategy adopts a three-pronged approach to
implement HWTS nationwide i.e. behaviour-first approach, public private partnership approach and
commercial/business approach. (National Strategy for Household Water and Treatment and Safe
Storage, Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development, Republic of Ghana, May 2014)
This initiative is also aligned with the principles of the Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) system
created by the World health Organization. The WASH system has been adopted by the Ghana
Government and its Ghana Health Service (GHS). BWF’s program employs compatible principles and is
conducted with full cooperation and support from both the District Health and Education Directorates.
The BWF initiative supports the efforts of both public and private water development agencies in not
only “accessing” water sources, but also ensuring consistently “safe” water to every household. The
BWF approach fills an important gap in the water supply chain, especially for rural dwellers. Many
villagers take water from contaminated sources. Even safe water taken from deep boreholes or other
sources has been shown to be contaminated by the time it is drawn, transported, and placed in
household water supply vessels. The BWF Teach-Test-Treat approach teaches and enables individual
households to independently treat and safely store water for family use.
Local Safe Water Educators (SWEs) and volunteer staff, as well as district health and education
directorates, are trained by BWF project teams in the rudiments of the Teach-Test-Treat practices. The
local health directorate takes the lead in selecting public health leaders in the villages.
Safe Water Educators (SWEs) are identified at the village level to provide coordination for:

st.subheader('II. Project Description')

st.write('''
The Project’s target population is a multi-village area including the Sankubenase, Nkurakan, Amonom,
Mampong and Wekpeti villages in Atiwa West District, Eastern Region, with a total population of about
5,800 residents. Two Latter-day Saint congregations are among the households in these communities. A
cohort of 159 households (approximate 20% sample) was selected, using 2020 Ghana Census mapping,
and employing a systematic sampling technique. Periodic surveys and household water tests were
used to evaluate the effectiveness of household compliance in applying safe water principles and
practices throughout the year.

st.write('''
**Community Survey Demographics.** To understand the make-up of the local communities, several
demographic questions were asked during the initial survey, prior to the safe water education
intervention. A summary of this information is shown in the two tables below:
''')

st.write('''
This is a rural population, set in a tropical
rainforest area where small scale agriculture is
dominant. Cocoa, cassava, maize, and plantain
are among the most common crops. Typical of West Africa, about half the population is less than 15 years of age.
''')


st.write('''
Access to public education in the district has been limited to Primary and Jr. High School. In this
population, 40% of household heads had only primary education. 30% of household heads had a Jr.
High education, and 8% reported having earned a senior high school certificate. Only 3% of household
heads had any education beyond high school. Until recently, Jr. High School marked the end of
compensatory education in Ghana. High School was recently made a requirement for all students, but
the lack of senior high schools in the country makes the requirement moot for many youths. However,
A new technical senior high school has just opened its doors in Abomosu for students living in this area.
Drilled boreholes is the dominent source of water for more than 60% of the population. Though not
noted by the survey, several rivers and smaller streams running through the district are also used by
villagers in more remote areas, particularly during the dry season. Gold mining has seriously
contaminated river water, however, making it dangerous to use for drinking/cooking. 60% of the
population fetch water two or more times per day. 70% of villagers will spend up to 15 minutes
fetching water, while 15% of villagers walk 30-45 minutes or more to access a local water source.
Nearly 60% of water was reported collected by a person older than 15 years (42% female, 16% male).

Ordinal regression was used to examine whether the likelihood of treating water
increased over time (i.e., if time was a significant predictor of people’s responses,
indicating that the program is working). Compared to the initial survey, people
completing subsequent surveys were associated with a 8.67 (time 1) and 8.13 (time 2) increase in log odds, respectively. In other words, the likelihood of treating
water increased immensely after people started the program.

#### 1. Staff Training
A competent cadre of 35 Safe Water Educators (SWEs) and village volunteers were
identified for the target communities. An eight-day training was provided by a U.S. team in
September 2021 on all facets of the BWF methodology. All SWEs were high school graduates or
college educated. Many were local district health workers or classroom teachers. All lived in or near
their assigned work areas. Each SWE was assigned 100-125 households to contact and teach. At
least one government district health and education representative from each directorate was
appointed and thoroughly trained with the SWEs. These representatives have provided ongoing
government coordination with the project. Attrition of staff was minimal.
""")
st.markdown("""
#### 2. Village Education
A total of 1,144 village education meetings were reported during the 12-month
period by the SWEs and village volunteers. Each meeting was verified by a household telephone
number, number of adults attending, and number of gratis chlorine tablets distributed. As
indicated in the table summary above, 4,214 adults were reported attending the education
meetings. These numbers include adults who attended more than one meeting in order to receive
all four education lessons. In most cases individual households were educated at their homes
(compounds), although in some cases two or more households attended together. Virtually all
students enrolled in the local village schools were also given safe water instruction.

st.markdown("""
#### 3. Household Drinking Water Quality
Two measures were used to discern changes in the quality of
water in household water supplies.
##### a. Periodic Surveys
Each sample household was queried about water use behaviors in the home,
including water treatment, at the onset of the project, prior to the Bright Water Teach-Test-
#Treat intervention. Subsequent surveys were conducted at the end of the 6th and 12th months
of the project. The following results were reported:
""")
st.write("""
Note that the
initial survey in September 2021 (Blue line), had 41% of respondents reporting that they did
not know the last time their household water had been treated, with the remainder (57%)
indicating their water was seldom if every treated. These numbers drastically shifted in June
and September 2022, when virtually all respondents reported treating their water "Always"
(80% and 71%) or "Sometimes" (19% and 29%) respectively. It should also be noted, however,
that there was a nearly 10% reduction in the "Always" treated survey option between the 2 nd
and 3 rd reporting periods, raising questions about the long-term sustainability of this practice
without continuing reinforcement.


There was a remarkable increase in the percentage of households who, by their responses, saw
value in the safe water principles and practices taught and desired to have safe water in the
home for the family.
A second survey question asked respondents to more specifically about their household water
treatment behaviors: "When was the last time you treated your water?" The following
chart/table displays the responses:

Since virtually none of the respondents reported treating their water on the initial survey, only
the second and third queries were used to measure frequency of water treatment. These
responses clarify timelines when household water supplies were treated. About 45% of
respondents indicated it had been "1-3 days" since the last household water treatment, with
another 37-38% indicating "4-7 days" since the last water treatment. Those two responses
accounted for more than 80% of respondents. It should be noted that 40% of households
reported replenishing their water supplies either once or twice in a week, which would provide
an acceptable treatment timeline for maintaining safe drinking/food preparation water in the
home for that group.
b. Household Water Testing. A second check was made on household water quality among the
sample cohort by obtaining a water sample and testing it using both rapid Colilert and Petrifilm
microbiology testing protocols. These tests specifically detect E. coli bacteria in the water, the
most common organism causing diarrheal disease in humans. All on-the-ground project
management and SWEs were trained in the conducting of these tests. The Portable
Microbiological Laboratory test results are shown below:

""")


st.markdown('$\\tilde{\chi}^2$ Significance at p <.001')
st.markdown('$\\tilde{\chi}^2$ Significance at p <.001')

st.write("""
As the reader can see from the tables above, marked improvements are seen in household
water quality over the course of the year. Initial testing before intervention revealed almost all
(99%) Colilert and Petrifilm results showed either moderate or high-risk for disease in
September 2021, as shown by the blue bars. The same tests done in June 2022 (orange bars)
and again in September 2022 (green bars) resulted in significantly higher numbers of "safe"
results for drinking and major reductions in moderate or high-risk for disease samples (29% or
less). Both these tests showed chi squared statistical significance at the p&lt; .001 level. These
laboratory test results verify the word-of-mouth responses shown by the periodic surveys in
"Periodic Surveys section a." above. Water quality was indeed improved presumably due to
chemical treatment and more careful handling of household water supplies.
c. Community Water Source Testing. Safe Water Educators (SWEs) were asked to identify all
major community water sources and to take periodic water samples as instructed using standard
laboratory procedures. These samples were then inoculated into both Colilert and Petrifilm test
mediums and incubated for 24 hours to determine levels of risk. These tests were done to
provide a baseline for the levels of contamination in water sources used for household use.
Nothing was done to alter water quality at the community water sources. A total of 59 water
sources were initially tested in the five target communities. At mid-year, data from 50 (85%) of
the initial water sources were reported by SWEs. In September 2022 data for only 35 (60%) of
the selected water sources were tested for the third time. A summary of results for both tests
are provided in the tables to the right and
below.

The data from both laboratory tests using
community water source samples show
high levels of contamination. Colilert tests
revealed moderate and high-risk results in
86%, 64%, and 69 % of the community
water sources throughout the year.

Childhood Episodes of Diarrhea

Sep - 21 Jun - 22 Sep - 22

Petrifilm tests, which verify Colilert results by counting E. coli colonies on the Petrifilm medium,
showed moderate risk (Unsafe to drink) and high risk (Dangerous to drink) results in 61%, 68%,
and 74% of water samples respectively during the same three testing periods. These results
verify there is little change in the quality of local water sources over time, and that most of the
water taken from various sources for household use is contaminated and should be treated to
ensure avoidance of water-borne disease.
4. Diarrheal Disease Reduction in Children. A World Health Organization critical indicator for safe
water is the prevalence of diarrheal illness in children, particularly those under five years of
age.
a. Episodes of Diarrheal Illness. The Bright Water survey queried household respondents
regarding the number of episodes of illness during the past 7 days for children less than five
years and during the past 14 days for school-aged children. Over the course of the year, the
number of illnesses reduced substantially.

Significant reductions in the number of episodes of illness were reported for both children
less than 5 years and school-aged children when compared to the baseline survey data.
Those less than 5 years showed 75% and 50% reductions in diarrhea for the 6-month (Jun-22) and 12-month (Sep-22) queries. It is not fully understood why cases increased in the
middle of the year. The study did not take into consideration seasonal changes or disease
outbreaks in the community that may account for some of the illness. School-aged children
were reported to have 60% fewer cases mid-year (orange bar) and 82% fewer cases at year-
end (green bar). Again, statistical significance was obtained.
b. Loss of Productivity. Loss of productivity was also considered when related to diarrheal
disease. The survey queried sample households on how many total school days [in your
household] have school-age children missed due to illness in the last two weeks? Another
survey question asked, In the last two weeks, how many total days have adult members of
your family been unable to do work due to stomach pain/diarrhea illness? Summary data is
shown in the table below:

An 89% decrease in school days lost were reported at mid-year (orange bar), when compared to
the baseline information gathered with the same families six months earlier (blue bar). And 91%
fewer days lost were reported at year-end (green bar). It should be noted, however, that a new
academic year was just begun in early September 2022, which might account for some of the
reductions in the year-end results.
Adult work-loss was reported to be 92% less at mid-year (orange bar) of the study when compared
with the baseline data in September 2021. An additional few percentage points (95%) were added
to the lessening work-loss by year-end (green bar).

These four outcome measures provide significant evidence that people are interested in clean, safe
water. When basic safe water principles and practices are taught, villagers have taken action to protect
their families from disease caused by contaminated water. Numbers of diarrheal cases declined and
school/work loss was lessened significantly as household water quality improved.
